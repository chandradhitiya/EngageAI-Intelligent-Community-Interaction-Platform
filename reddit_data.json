        "content": "How to cook a hard-boiled egg?\n\nWhile everyone seems to be able to answer this question, the result is not always perfect! Reading through several recipes, you will find long, short or even sometimes crazy cooking times! To achieve a perfect boiled hard-boiled egg, there are a few basic rules to follow. And as always, with everything to do with food, it's quality that comes first.\n\nRemember to choose your eggs by paying attention to a few points. If you are lucky enough to find some directly from the farm, don't hesitate. In this case, it is always freshness that is important. But if you can't, try to find eggs from free-range hens. You can find this information directly on the shell, thanks to a compulsory marking. Once you have made your purchases, you can start cooking. Generally, the 3 - 6 - 9 rule will be applied. That is to say:\n\n3 minutes of cooking time for soft-boiled eggs.\n\n6 minutes for soft-boiled eggs.\n\n9 to 10 minutes for hard-boiled eggs.\n\nBut for perfect cooking of your hard-boiled eggs, there are a few tips. Because there is nothing more unpleasant than having difficulty peeling them. Some chefs recommend adding baking soda or a dash of white kitchen vinegar to your cooking water. This trick will make the shell more crumbly, making it easier to peel. But there's another tip that seems to work as well. First, soak your eggs in cold water for a few minutes before cooking them. Then place them in your pot of boiling water for at least 9 minutes. And as soon as this time has elapsed, plunge them into cold water again until they have cooled completely. This method allows the white membrane to peel off the shell. And these two successive baths of cold water will allow you to shell your eggs much more easily.\n\nAnother important point is that it is not necessary to store your eggs in the refrigerator. In fact, you will never find this food on the shelves of your store. And in restaurants, the state control bodies in charge of food safety even prohibit putting eggs in the fridge.\n\nNow you know everything you need to cook your hard-boiled eggs perfectly. And to make peeling easier for you, there is also a little tip. Take hold of the egg and crush it very lightly on a hard, flat surface. Roll it back and forth so that the shell cracks along its entire length. This will allow you to peel it much more easily.\n\nYou will then have the perfect hard-boiled egg for all your culinary desires. It can be eaten simply with a little salt or mayonnaise. The \"9 minutes\" egg can also be used in more elaborate compositions. It will be the ally of your most inventive salads. It can also be breaded and fried for a crispier result. In fact, egg-based recipes are endless. Rich in proteins and also cheap, it is a friend of your diet.",

If you don’t like the taste of the backyard eggs, they may be eating things like garlic & onion- that gives eggs a fishy taste. \n\nThe orange-yellow color comes from Xanthophylls & Carotenes (naturally occurring plant pigments) in their diet. High Xanthophyll content = more yellow (can be found in Alfalfa for example). High Carotene content = more Orange (can be found in Corn for example)\n\nThings like Alfalfa meal, Kale, Rape (the plant not the thing sickos do), Clover, Rye Pasture Grass, Mustard (the plant not the condiment), Pennycress, & Shepard’s Purse all influence the color of the yolk. Too much Cottonseed causes the yolk to be salmon colored, dark green, or almost black. \n\nPastured hens are more likely to give you the dark yolked eggs due to eating various plants they find in the field. There are over 10,000 types of grass alone, all with different nutritional capabilities/normal ranges. Those ranges are impacted by the health & composition of your soil.",

Maybe farms choose not to really show people what happens “behind the scenes” because it’s so easy for people to take videos and pictures and doctor them to make farmers look bad. Or they’ll find little things in the pictures or videos and claim it’s animal abuse or something. \n\nAs for free range farming, I personally really like the idea of it. I started out by raising backyard chickens and they got to be outside (in an enclosed area), so it’s what I’m more used to. I’m also working closely with the owner of the company I work for and I might become a contract grower for them in the future and produce free range eggs. And like my animal science professors always said, “there’s room for all methods of farming in the market.”",

        "content": "Went to Mexico a few years to a resort. Their breakfast was great. The had a egg station. I got sunny side up almost every day. The yolk was more orange than yellow and the egg white really didn’t have the bitter taste. I’m in the US. I tried every egg on the shelf and even someone’s local eggs. Nothing seems to compare to the taste. Any idea what it was that made them so different or suggestions on a brand? I was thinking it was the type of feed for the chicken.",

This price is only outdone by Hawaii, which comes in at a whopping $7, according to the data mining site Expatistan.\n\n[Egg prices soar 47% in latest inflation woe for consumers](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/inflation/egg-prices-up-inflation-california-consumers) (Aug 2022)",

Some kinds of egg contain no yolk, for example because they are laid in situations where the food supply is sufficient (such as in the body of the host of a parasitoid) or because the embryo develops in the parent's body, which supplies the food, usually through a placenta. Reproductive systems in which the mother's body supplies the embryo directly are said to be matrotrophic; those in which the embryo is supplied by yolk are said to be lecithotrophic. In many species, such as all birds, and most reptiles and insects, the yolk takes the form of a special storage organ constructed in the reproductive tract of the mother.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/eggs/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

        "content": "How to cook a hard-boiled egg?\n\nWhile everyone seems to be able to answer this question, the result is not always perfect! Reading through several recipes, you will find long, short or even sometimes crazy cooking times! To achieve a perfect boiled hard-boiled egg, there are a few basic rules to follow. And as always, with everything to do with food, it's quality that comes first.\n\nRemember to choose your eggs by paying attention to a few points. If you are lucky enough to find some directly from the farm, don't hesitate. In this case, it is always freshness that is important. But if you can't, try to find eggs from free-range hens. You can find this information directly on the shell, thanks to a compulsory marking. Once you have made your purchases, you can start cooking. Generally, the 3 - 6 - 9 rule will be applied. That is to say:\n\n3 minutes of cooking time for soft-boiled eggs.\n\n6 minutes for soft-boiled eggs.\n\n9 to 10 minutes for hard-boiled eggs.\n\nBut for perfect cooking of your hard-boiled eggs, there are a few tips. Because there is nothing more unpleasant than having difficulty peeling them. Some chefs recommend adding baking soda or a dash of white kitchen vinegar to your cooking water. This trick will make the shell more crumbly, making it easier to peel. But there's another tip that seems to work as well. First, soak your eggs in cold water for a few minutes before cooking them. Then place them in your pot of boiling water for at least 9 minutes. And as soon as this time has elapsed, plunge them into cold water again until they have cooled completely. This method allows the white membrane to peel off the shell. And these two successive baths of cold water will allow you to shell your eggs much more easily.\n\nAnother important point is that it is not necessary to store your eggs in the refrigerator. In fact, you will never find this food on the shelves of your store. And in restaurants, the state control bodies in charge of food safety even prohibit putting eggs in the fridge.\n\nNow you know everything you need to cook your hard-boiled eggs perfectly. And to make peeling easier for you, there is also a little tip. Take hold of the egg and crush it very lightly on a hard, flat surface. Roll it back and forth so that the shell cracks along its entire length. This will allow you to peel it much more easily.\n\nYou will then have the perfect hard-boiled egg for all your culinary desires. It can be eaten simply with a little salt or mayonnaise. The \"9 minutes\" egg can also be used in more elaborate compositions. It will be the ally of your most inventive salads. It can also be breaded and fried for a crispier result. In fact, egg-based recipes are endless. Rich in proteins and also cheap, it is a friend of your diet.",

The color is basically painted on and can be scratched off somewhat if you try hard enough. The hens claws tend to scrape off some color when shuffling around in a nest with eggs, trying to get comfortable enough to lay herself. If the hens are all eating the same staple diet, then the eggs will taste similar. Maybe some extra protein if a certain hen has ate more bugs or has been with a rooster (you know...) I don't have any roosters at the moment so no fertile eggs.\n\nMaybe try a farmers market or something, you might find some true free-range eggs for a little cheaper than whole foods.

Free run, on the other hand, as misleading as it sounds, means that the chickens are stuck in larger cages where they can move around. This, free range is far superior to free run, and this is reflected in the price of the eggs, and IMHO, their quality (thicker, more consistently formed shells, firmer egg whites, natural-looking yolk sacs that don’t burst when you look at them wrong).\n\nAny indication on the packaging which farm(s) produce these? Generally Grey Ridge is the sketchiest one of them all: a huge corporate conglomerate of countless farms that mass-produce eggs. Some of their brands also have weirdly bright orangeish-yellow egg yolks that seem unnatural to me.\n\nBurnbrae seems like a good balance in price and quality.",

Because the birds stay inside during the avian flu, it’s actually safer for us to eat the eggs and for the workers there as well. I like Vital Farms too, but they use a lot of land to grow feed for the chickens, whereas Kipster focuses on using land to grow food for people, which seems more efficient to me.\n\nAlso, if chickens are kept outside, they’re more likely to get attacked by predators. I think this new approach is a good balance between animal welfare, sustainability, and supporting farmers with fair prices. And once the avian flu is under control, the chickens will be able to go outside again (like now). Plus, by using food waste to feed the chickens, Kipster is doing something really positive for reducing overall food waste.\n\nIn the end, if we all consumed fewer animal products, I think things would be better for the animals and the planet.",

        "content": "How to cook a hard-boiled egg?\n\nWhile everyone seems to be able to answer this question, the result is not always perfect! Reading through several recipes, you will find long, short or even sometimes crazy cooking times! To achieve a perfect boiled hard-boiled egg, there are a few basic rules to follow. And as always, with everything to do with food, it's quality that comes first.\n\nRemember to choose your eggs by paying attention to a few points. If you are lucky enough to find some directly from the farm, don't hesitate. In this case, it is always freshness that is important. But if you can't, try to find eggs from free-range hens. You can find this information directly on the shell, thanks to a compulsory marking. Once you have made your purchases, you can start cooking. Generally, the 3 - 6 - 9 rule will be applied. That is to say:\n\n3 minutes of cooking time for soft-boiled eggs.\n\n6 minutes for soft-boiled eggs.\n\n9 to 10 minutes for hard-boiled eggs.\n\nBut for perfect cooking of your hard-boiled eggs, there are a few tips. Because there is nothing more unpleasant than having difficulty peeling them. Some chefs recommend adding baking soda or a dash of white kitchen vinegar to your cooking water. This trick will make the shell more crumbly, making it easier to peel. But there's another tip that seems to work as well. First, soak your eggs in cold water for a few minutes before cooking them. Then place them in your pot of boiling water for at least 9 minutes. And as soon as this time has elapsed, plunge them into cold water again until they have cooled completely. This method allows the white membrane to peel off the shell. And these two successive baths of cold water will allow you to shell your eggs much more easily.\n\nAnother important point is that it is not necessary to store your eggs in the refrigerator. In fact, you will never find this food on the shelves of your store. And in restaurants, the state control bodies in charge of food safety even prohibit putting eggs in the fridge.\n\nNow you know everything you need to cook your hard-boiled eggs perfectly. And to make peeling easier for you, there is also a little tip. Take hold of the egg and crush it very lightly on a hard, flat surface. Roll it back and forth so that the shell cracks along its entire length. This will allow you to peel it much more easily.\n\nYou will then have the perfect hard-boiled egg for all your culinary desires. It can be eaten simply with a little salt or mayonnaise. The \"9 minutes\" egg can also be used in more elaborate compositions. It will be the ally of your most inventive salads. It can also be breaded and fried for a crispier result. In fact, egg-based recipes are endless. Rich in proteins and also cheap, it is a friend of your diet.",

Free range, etc. are fine too, in fact I’ve liked some of those I’ve tried.\n\nOk folks, let me hear your thoughts! In some countries outside the United States you can get much richer dairy and produce on account of all the factors we can imagine. I’m looking for eggs here in the United States, which I can get in a store, that have a very deep, rich orange yolk and that are extremely flavorful. Basically it seems to go like this- the more I go toward el cheapo mass-produced brown carton eggs the more the yolks tend to go toward near-white and water-flavored. However, going in the opposite direction hardly guarantees greatness. I’ve been through so many different $5 to $8 dollar a dozen cartons whose yolks are nothing to write home about. So where are my orange beauties? Would love your advice. Thanks!\n\nI’ve tried:\n\nHappy\n\nVital\n\nHandsome\n\nNature’s Yoke\n\nOnly NY were good, and even those weren’t stellar.",

The color is basically painted on and can be scratched off somewhat if you try hard enough. The hens claws tend to scrape off some color when shuffling around in a nest with eggs, trying to get comfortable enough to lay herself. If the hens are all eating the same staple diet, then the eggs will taste similar. Maybe some extra protein if a certain hen has ate more bugs or has been with a rooster (you know...) I don't have any roosters at the moment so no fertile eggs.\n\nMaybe try a farmers market or something, you might find some true free-range eggs for a little cheaper than whole foods. I think my local produce stand has fresh free-range eggs for like $6 a flat.",

                "text": "Free range sounds good in theory. It’s the situation where the chickens get an open area to roam and roost in. Free run, on the other hand, as misleading as it sounds, means that the chickens are stuck in larger cages where they can move around. This, free range is far superior to free run, and this is reflected in the price of the eggs, and IMHO, their quality (thicker, more consistently formed shells, firmer egg whites, natural-looking yolk sacs that don’t burst when you look at them wrong).\n\nAny indication on the packaging which farm(s) produce these? Generally Grey Ridge is the sketchiest one of them all: a huge corporate conglomerate of countless farms that mass-produce eggs. Some of their brands also have weirdly bright orangeish-yellow egg yolks that seem unnatural to me.\n\nBurnbrae seems like a good balance in price and quality.",

Because the birds stay inside during the avian flu, it’s actually safer for us to eat the eggs and for the workers there as well. I like Vital Farms too, but they use a lot of land to grow feed for the chickens, whereas Kipster focuses on using land to grow food for people, which seems more efficient to me.\n\nAlso, if chickens are kept outside, they’re more likely to get attacked by predators. I think this new approach is a good balance between animal welfare, sustainability, and supporting farmers with fair prices. And once the avian flu is under control, the chickens will be able to go outside again (like now). Plus, by using food waste to feed the chickens, Kipster is doing something really positive for reducing overall food waste.\n\nIn the end, if we all consumed fewer animal products, I think things would be better for the animals and the planet.",

        "content": "How to cook a hard-boiled egg?\n\nWhile everyone seems to be able to answer this question, the result is not always perfect! Reading through several recipes, you will find long, short or even sometimes crazy cooking times! To achieve a perfect boiled hard-boiled egg, there are a few basic rules to follow. And as always, with everything to do with food, it's quality that comes first.\n\nRemember to choose your eggs by paying attention to a few points. If you are lucky enough to find some directly from the farm, don't hesitate. In this case, it is always freshness that is important. But if you can't, try to find eggs from free-range hens. You can find this information directly on the shell, thanks to a compulsory marking. Once you have made your purchases, you can start cooking. Generally, the 3 - 6 - 9 rule will be applied. That is to say:\n\n3 minutes of cooking time for soft-boiled eggs.\n\n6 minutes for soft-boiled eggs.\n\n9 to 10 minutes for hard-boiled eggs.\n\nBut for perfect cooking of your hard-boiled eggs, there are a few tips. Because there is nothing more unpleasant than having difficulty peeling them. Some chefs recommend adding baking soda or a dash of white kitchen vinegar to your cooking water. This trick will make the shell more crumbly, making it easier to peel. But there's another tip that seems to work as well. First, soak your eggs in cold water for a few minutes before cooking them. Then place them in your pot of boiling water for at least 9 minutes. And as soon as this time has elapsed, plunge them into cold water again until they have cooled completely. This method allows the white membrane to peel off the shell. And these two successive baths of cold water will allow you to shell your eggs much more easily.\n\nAnother important point is that it is not necessary to store your eggs in the refrigerator. In fact, you will never find this food on the shelves of your store. And in restaurants, the state control bodies in charge of food safety even prohibit putting eggs in the fridge.\n\nNow you know everything you need to cook your hard-boiled eggs perfectly. And to make peeling easier for you, there is also a little tip. Take hold of the egg and crush it very lightly on a hard, flat surface. Roll it back and forth so that the shell cracks along its entire length. This will allow you to peel it much more easily.\n\nYou will then have the perfect hard-boiled egg for all your culinary desires. It can be eaten simply with a little salt or mayonnaise. The \"9 minutes\" egg can also be used in more elaborate compositions. It will be the ally of your most inventive salads. It can also be breaded and fried for a crispier result. In fact, egg-based recipes are endless. Rich in proteins and also cheap, it is a friend of your diet.",

Free range, etc. are fine too, in fact I’ve liked some of those I’ve tried.\n\nOk folks, let me hear your thoughts! In some countries outside the United States you can get much richer dairy and produce on account of all the factors we can imagine. I’m looking for eggs here in the United States, which I can get in a store, that have a very deep, rich orange yolk and that are extremely flavorful. Basically it seems to go like this- the more I go toward el cheapo mass-produced brown carton eggs the more the yolks tend to go toward near-white and water-flavored. However, going in the opposite direction hardly guarantees greatness. I’ve been through so many different $5 to $8 dollar a dozen cartons whose yolks are nothing to write home about.

Same with organic too there’s many things not labeled organic that are superior products because they didn’t register as organic or want to pay for the fees associated with it. Organic can have chemicals that are considered “organic” but truly are just chemicals and it’s a label meant for marketing a lot of the time, most use it to steer them towards quality but this is still something to consider. Get pasture raised with a guarantee they’ve been foraging outdoors and you’ll find something better than both of these in terms of quality of life nutrients and flavor profile",

Add in that they have fewer locations so going to Costco often means driving more.\n\nMy second qualm is the pricing, unit price on staple products is competitive with Walmart et al but certainly not always better. For some goods, the quality is superior, but that is also not the case generally despite consumer perceptions with brand associations.\n\nMy third qualm is tied to the second, they attract customers with reasonably priced staple products and then absolutely rake in the cash on others. I first discovered this with ZipLoc brand baggies...I quickly looked up the unit price at Walmart and it was the same, I just had to buy 4 times as much at Costco. This sort of sales tactic also leads to overconsumption generally. \n\nI'll give credit where it's due, they are capturing significant value with a model that targets everything that is wrong with American consumption.",

They weren't in cages, but definitely had a miserable existence. If you search for eggs on Facebook marketplace or Craigslist you can buy farm fresh eggs straight from the farmer for only a few bucks per dozen. Most of them will prefer to meet you in town and some will even deliver. The yolks are always orange and the shells are usually colorful. Eggs keep for a very long time, so I usually drop 20 or 30 bucks when I buy them, then I have dozens and dozens of eggs for a month or two.",

                "text": "What the chickens eat impacts the flavor of the egg along with the color of the yolk. A lot of people feed their chickens food scraps as treats or as a way to cut feed costs. If you don’t like the taste of the backyard eggs, they may be eating things like garlic & onion- that gives eggs a fishy taste. \n\nThe orange-yellow color comes from Xanthophylls & Carotenes (naturally occurring plant pigments) in their diet. High Xanthophyll content = more yellow (can be found in Alfalfa for example). High Carotene content = more Orange (can be found in Corn for example)\n\nThings like Alfalfa meal, Kale, Rape (the plant not the thing sickos do), Clover, Rye Pasture Grass, Mustard (the plant not the condiment), Pennycress, & Shepard’s Purse all influence the color of the yolk. Too much Cottonseed causes the yolk to be salmon colored, dark green, or almost black. \n\nPastured hens are more likely to give you the dark yolked eggs due to eating various plants they find in the field. There are over 10,000 types of grass alone, all with different nutritional capabilities/normal ranges. Those ranges are impacted by the health & composition of your soil.",

        "content": "How to cook a hard-boiled egg?\n\nWhile everyone seems to be able to answer this question, the result is not always perfect! Reading through several recipes, you will find long, short or even sometimes crazy cooking times! To achieve a perfect boiled hard-boiled egg, there are a few basic rules to follow. And as always, with everything to do with food, it's quality that comes first.\n\nRemember to choose your eggs by paying attention to a few points. If you are lucky enough to find some directly from the farm, don't hesitate. In this case, it is always freshness that is important. But if you can't, try to find eggs from free-range hens. You can find this information directly on the shell, thanks to a compulsory marking. Once you have made your purchases, you can start cooking. Generally, the 3 - 6 - 9 rule will be applied. That is to say:\n\n3 minutes of cooking time for soft-boiled eggs.\n\n6 minutes for soft-boiled eggs.\n\n9 to 10 minutes for hard-boiled eggs.\n\nBut for perfect cooking of your hard-boiled eggs, there are a few tips. Because there is nothing more unpleasant than having difficulty peeling them. Some chefs recommend adding baking soda or a dash of white kitchen vinegar to your cooking water. This trick will make the shell more crumbly, making it easier to peel. But there's another tip that seems to work as well. First, soak your eggs in cold water for a few minutes before cooking them. Then place them in your pot of boiling water for at least 9 minutes. And as soon as this time has elapsed, plunge them into cold water again until they have cooled completely. This method allows the white membrane to peel off the shell. And these two successive baths of cold water will allow you to shell your eggs much more easily.\n\nAnother important point is that it is not necessary to store your eggs in the refrigerator. In fact, you will never find this food on the shelves of your store. And in restaurants, the state control bodies in charge of food safety even prohibit putting eggs in the fridge.\n\nNow you know everything you need to cook your hard-boiled eggs perfectly. And to make peeling easier for you, there is also a little tip. Take hold of the egg and crush it very lightly on a hard, flat surface. Roll it back and forth so that the shell cracks along its entire length. This will allow you to peel it much more easily.\n\nYou will then have the perfect hard-boiled egg for all your culinary desires. It can be eaten simply with a little salt or mayonnaise. The \"9 minutes\" egg can also be used in more elaborate compositions. It will be the ally of your most inventive salads. It can also be breaded and fried for a crispier result. In fact, egg-based recipes are endless. Rich in proteins and also cheap, it is a friend of your diet.",

I also prefer some \"farm-raised/grass-fed\" types specifically for scrambled eggs in the morning; I dont care if \"organic\" is just marketing they simply just taste better than others\n\nimo, anyone that doesnt like eggs either isnt buying the right ones and they arent cooking them right or they had a bad experience someone made some for them and they were gross so now they dont like eggs but lowkey they do they just dont know it\n\nedit 2: you can also try adding 1-2tbsp of vinegar while boiling but personally this never made much of a difference for me it matters more what brand/how fresh",

I was a hungry boi and desperate for food, and all there was left were 3 16-pack eggs. So i fried another 5 eggs. Roundabout 3 hours later i fried another 6 eggs. Sofar i’ve consumed 17 eggs today, and it’s to the point where im conserned for my safety. I wonder how much cholesterol is flowing thru my veins. \n\nHere i am, writing this on r/eggs. Hungry. Hesitant to frying another 6 eggs. That’ll add the total to 23 eggs today. Ive eaten nothing but eggs, other than 1 liter of milk and coffee. \n\nAm i going to die if i eat more eggs?\n\nSidenote: the picture above is related (death)",

Then I saw a video of Gordon Ramsey making scrambled eggs and I was like oh my God that looks horrifying. Now I can't stop seeing them. Eggs taste good to me but they \"give me the ick\" how a lot of people describe eggs. Any eggs I eat have to be very overcooked for me to enjoy them. The wetness makes me nauseous. But the wet paste soup of scrambled eggs is all these scary things. I cant take looking at it. It scares me. Same reaction when a person looks at a creepy crawly",
